		<div class="one-half">
			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
			<p>The mission of eSports History is to create a centralized place for the rich history of eSports. To research and document
				as much of this history as possible and bring it to fans both new and old.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="one-half">
			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>In 2018 eSports History was born after years of toying around with the idea. We had a small launch and committed ourselves
				to putting out the best content we could while covering as many topics as possible. We started out with brief episodes
				covering the basics of a host of topics before later going into deep dives on our podcast. We hope to share our passion
				of eSports and bring its rich history to as many people as possible.

		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>I began my journey in eSports shortly after the release of Halo 3 with my introduction to MLG and Gamebattles. Up until
			November 2007 I was stuck with dial up internet and never had the chance to explore Xbox Live before then. Once I started
			I was hooked and started watching MLG broadcasts and getting excited for the upcoming Halo 3 season in 2008.</p>
		<p>Through MLG I got my introduction to eSports and began exploring other games and events within the eSports ecosystem. I
			watched documentaries, followed other scenes such as Starcraft and Melee, and eventually started researching the origins
			of eSports. </p>
		<p>In college I majored in History and wrote my thesis paper on broadcasting structures in eSports as compared to sports(was
			one of the only ways I could get my professor to let me write on eSports). In the years that followed I bounced around
			to various jobs and locations but I never stopped gaming or following eSports. I knew I wanted to do something in the
			eSports scene and originally I wanted nothing else than to become a professional gamer. Ultimately I never managed to
			attain that dream but I always had the idea of doing something with the history of eSports. After years of procrastinating
			I finally started this journey in 2018 with the mission of documenting the rich history of eSports and bringing that to
			a wider audience.</p>
		<p>So I invite you to join me on this journey as we peel back the curtains and cover eSports in a way that few have done before.
			As time goes on I hope to bring higher quality content and to foster a community that loves eSports as much as I do.</p>
